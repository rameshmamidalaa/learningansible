# CREATING A SECRETS VAULT.
# Note that I have already encrypted the password which is stored under group_vars-->all-->vault iof this folder structure/project.
# To encrypt the password, use the following cmd: ansible-vault encrypt vault where 'vault' is available under group_vars-->all-->vault iof this folder structure/project.
# To decrypt the password, user the following cmd: ansible-vault edit vault (It will open in memory instead of writing into disc. Of course due to security constraints.)
# Example cmd: ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts_groups_vm vault.yml --ask-vault-pass (when you enter the cmd it prompts for the vault_password as it is encrypted with by giving the following pwd: 123)
# To remove the password file from the remote systems use the following cmd:  ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts_groups_vm vault.yml --tags delete --ask-vault-pass
