# Gather the ansible facts. Using this option in playbooks, we can check for the required facts.
# for example: you can install service if the OS family is REDHAT- ansible_facts['os_family'] == RedHat
# To execute the cmd: ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts_vm ansible-facts.yml
# It has the MAGIC VARIABLES - These are reserved, cannot be set by the user and there are many magic variables.
# https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/special_variables.html#magic
# Most commonly used 'magic' variables are: hostvars, groups, group_names, inventory_hostname
# For Example: {{ hostvars['rhhost2.localnet.com']['ansible_facts']['distribution'] }}
# Looping Using Magic vars: Just have look 2-13-template.j2 or the below
# For Example:
# {% for host in groups['webservers'] %}
#  {{ hostvars[host]['ansible_facts']['enp0s8']['ipv4']['address'] }}
# {% endfor %}
